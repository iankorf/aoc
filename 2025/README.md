AOC 2025
========

- 01 is mostly modulo, integer divide, and conditional OOE
- 02 is mostly sets, but also kmer-like
- 03 was weirdly hard for me because I kept trying stupid data structures
- 04 is simple 2D graph navigation and update
- 05 combining feature overlaps
- 06 more difficult to understand than difficult to solve
